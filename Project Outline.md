#Resilience Project April 2015
Jake Heare
##Background

In a reciprocal transplant experiment that I ran last year, I found that Dabob oysters survived better in harsh environments than did Fidalgo or Oyster Bay oysters. I assumed this is related to a heritable stress resilience trait that the Dabob population has developed in relation with its hostile home environment. To investigate this trait, I will be performing a stress experiment using oysters from each of the three populations. I will be looking for significant differences in mRNA output before and after an induced stress event.

##Methods
From Manchester, I will collected 100 oysters from each population (300 total). 50 From each will be used for my experiment and 25 from each will be used for each lab section. 

The animals will be housed in FSH Aquarium room for 1 week prior to experiment to condition in the lab. FSH aquarium room aquarium should have a strong bacterial colony to support the animals. I will add shellfish diet to the animals every other day while they are conditioning. 

###On experiment day:

- Collect 20 pre heat shock samples from each group
- Place 30 animals on dry trays with a heating element keeping temps at 37C
- Stress for 1 hour
- Immediately sample 20 animals from each group post heat shock
- Place the remaining animals in aquarium 
- Sample remaining animals 24 hours post stress

###Sampling procedure:

- Use flame sterilized utensils
- Collect Mantle Tissue
- Place in clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
- Add 1 ml RNAlater
- Store appropriately

###RNA Process:
- RNAzol BD for RNA Extraction
- Completed undervent hood with sterile conditions
- Once RNA Isolation Complete begin cDNA creation

###cDNA Creation:
- Use standard cDNA creation kit on RNA samples
- cDNA used for qPCR

###qPCR
- Use HSP70 as target primer (In Jake's Primer Box 209)
- Use Actin as control primer(In Jake's Primer Box 209)
- Run with protocol described [here](http://genefish.wikispaces.com/Jake%27s+Notebook)
