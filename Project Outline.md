#Resilience Project April 2015

##Background

In a reciprocal transplant experiment that I ran last year, I found that Dabob oysters survived better in harsh environments than did Fidalgo or Oyster Bay oysters. I assumed this is related to a heritable stress resilience trait that the Dabob population has developed in relation with its hostile home environment. To investigate this trait, I will be performing a stress experiment using oysters from each of the three populations. I will be looking for significant differences in mRNA output before and after an induced stress event.
