##December 2013 Samples

Samples with dates 121713,121813,12913 were collected at 4 months post outplant due to a severe mortality event at Dabob bay. These samples were very small so they are whole body tissue frozen at -20. Samples were collected from the 17th to the 19th then processed in chronological order from the 20th to the 22nd of December. They were measured, weighed in shell, and the processed using flame sterilized tools. They are stored in individual 1.5 ml tubes and placed in freezer storage boxes with the date and population information on them. 

##January 2014 Samples
Samples with the date 12914 were collected after a second check at Dabob it was determined that a second mortality event had occurred. These samples were also very small so they are whole body tissue frozen at -20. Samples were collected on the 29th and processed on the 30th. They were measured, weighed in shell, and the processed using flame sterilized tools. They are stored in individual 1.5 ml tubes and placed in freezer storage boxes with the date and population information on them. 

##April 2014 Samples
Samples with the date 4192014 were collected when it was determined that very few animals had survived the winter at Dabob. These samples were also very small so they are whole body tissue frozen at -20. Samples were collected on the 19th and processed on the 20th. They were measured, weighed in shell, and the processed using flame sterilized tools. They are stored in individual 1.5 ml tubes and placed in freezer storage boxes with the date and population information on them. 

##May 2014 Samples

Samples with the date 52314 were collected at Oyster Bay after we found a mass mortality in a few trays at Oyster Bay. These samples were whole body tissue stored in RNAlater in 15 ml conicals. In the field, They were measured, weighed in shell, and the processed using flame sterilized tools on May 23rd. Samples were then transferred to the lab but have since gone missing. I believe they are in the -20 in 209 but I have not seen them since they were originally collected. 

##September 2014 Samples
Samples with the day 91914 were collected at Oyster Bay for the end of the year sampling. These samples were broken down into a small sample (a piece of ctenidia and mantle) and a large sample (half to whole body sample). These animals were collected on the 19th and processed on the 20th. They were measured, weighed in shell, and the processed using flame sterilized tools. They are stored in individual 1.5 ml tubes and placed in freezer storage boxes with the date and population information on them.
