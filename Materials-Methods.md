#Materials and Methods

##Broodstock and Larvae
Sites for adaptively different broodstock were selected based on which Puget Sound basin and distance between sites as well as other parameters such as water temperatures, historic studies of the species in the region, and anecdotal evidence of dissimilarities between populations. We chose Dabob Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Oyster Bay to collect broodstock. Puget Sound Restoration Fund collected broodstock (n= 600) in November 2012. The animals were conditioned at the Port Gamble until June 2013 and spawned. Larvae from each population were pooled and reared under flowing water conditions and fed microalgae ad libitum. The seed oysters were set on microcultch and cultivated until they reached shell length of 5 mm. 

##Outplant and Conditioning
From each population, 480 oysters (n =1440), we placed in trays in Clam Bay, WA. Originally the trays were placed at a subtidal elevation but to avoid extreme temperature events, the trays were relocated to a floating dock and hung in groups of three trays. The samples remained at the site from August 2013 to April 2015 to grow and develop. A previous study (Heare et al., 2015) monitored mortality, growth, and reproduction at the site for 1 year. Due to limited mortality at this site, 66 oysters were collected from each population (n = 198) in April 10th 2015. All samples were conditioned in a closed aquarium system to a temperature of 8&deg;C for 2 weeks. They were fed on a daily basis with commercial shellfish feed until the experiment. Water changes will occur once a week to reduce build up of harmful chemicals in the water. 

##Experimental Design
The populations were then split into two groups with 22 oysters in the Control group, 22 heat stress exposed, and 22 mechanical stress exposed. The control group will remain submerged in 8&deg;C salt water for the duration of the experiment. The heat stress group will be dropped into prewarmed 38&deg;C water for 1 hour. The mechanical stress group will be spun at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The start times for each population and each treatment will be staggered so that sample collection will occur at 1 hour post stress with little to no delay. Oysters will then be returned to 8&deg;C aquaria and fed on a daily basis for the remainder of the experiment. 


##Sampling
Using liquid nitrogen and flame sterilized equipment, mantle and ctenidia tissues will be collected from 7 oysters in each group from each population 1 hour post stress. After 24 hours, a second sample of 7 oysters from each population in each group will be collected. All tissues will be preserved in liquid nitrogen and held at -80 until they can be processed for RNA. The remaining 8 oysters will be monitored for 14 days post the experiment for mortality events. At the end of the two weeks, the remaining oysters will also be sampled for mRNA using the same protocol. 

##RNA, cDNA, qPCR
RNA will be extracted using Trizol under sterile conditions. The mRNA will then be converted to cDNA using the kit ?????. Once cDNA is created we will run a qPCR on it using ????? primers for HSP70 (general stress), HSP69 (heat inducible), citrate synthase (aerobic metabolism), glutamine synthetase (cell detoxification), caspase (cell death), and amylase (food uptake). We will use primers for Actin as a normalizing gene. 

##Statistical Analysis
Data from qPCR and from the monitoring will be analyized in R programming language using the base statistical analysis program and ggplot2.
