#Materials and Methods

##Experimental Design
Adult oysters from three founder populations (Dabob Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Oyster Bay) grown for XXXX months at Clam Bay, WA wre used for this experiment. All oysters were held at 8&deg;C for two weeks at the University of Washington prior to the experiment.  Oyster from each population were subjected to acute temperature stress (38&deg;C water for 1 hour; n=22), mechanical stress (1000 rpm x 5 min; n=22) or served as controls (mainted at 8&deg;C ; n=22).   All oysters were placed back in  8&deg;C seawater and sampled at 1 hour post stress (n=8), 24 hours post stress (n=8), and six oysters were monitored daily for 14 dayfor mortality.  Ctenidia and mantle tissue was dissected and stored at -80 for later analysis.


##RNA, cDNA, qPCR
###RNA Isolation
Ctenidia stored in 1mL RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) at -80C were thawed and homogenized with disposable plastic pestles (ThermoFisher). RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol for total RNA isolation. Briefly, 400μL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O was added to the homogenate, vortexed for 15 seconds, and incuabated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The samples were centrifuged for 15 minutes, 16,000g, at room temperature. After centrifugation, 750μL of the supernatent was transferred to a clean tube, added an equal volume of isopropanol (750μL), mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutees at room temperature. The supernatatent was discarded and the pellets were washed with 500μL of 75% ethanol (made with 0.1% DEPC-H2O) and centrifuged at 4,000g for 3 minutes at room temperature. Repeated wash step one time. Ethanol was removed and pellets were resuspended in 100μL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Samples were quantified using a NanoDrop1000 (ThermoFisher) and stored at -80C.


Once cDNA is created we will run a qPCR on it using ????? primers for HSP70 (general stress). We will use primers for Actin as a normalizing gene. 

##Statistical Analysis
Data from qPCR and from the monitoring will be analyized in R programming language using the base statistical analysis program and ggplot2.
