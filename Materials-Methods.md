#Materials and Methods

##Experimental Design
Adult oysters from three founder populations (Dabob Bay, Fidalgo Bay, and Oyster Bay) grown for XXXX months at Clam Bay, WA wre used for this experiment. All oysters were held at 8&deg;C for two weeks at the University of Washington prior to the experiment.  Oyster from each population were subjected to acute temperature stress (38&deg;C water for 1 hour; n=22), mechanical stress (1000 rpm x 5 min; n=22) or served as controls (mainted at 8&deg;C ; n=22).   All oysters were placed back in  8&deg;C seawater and sampled at 1 hour post stress (n=8), 24 hours post stress (n=8), and six oysters were monitored daily for 14 dayfor mortality.  Ctenidia and mantle tissue was dissected and stored at -80 for later analysis.


##RNA, cDNA
RNA will be extracted using RNAzol under sterile conditions. The mRNA will then be converted to cDNA using Reverse transcriptase. Once cDNA is created we will run a qPCR on it using ????? primers for HSP70 (general stress). We will use primers for Actin as a normalizing gene. 

## Quantitative PCR



##Statistical Analysis
Data from qPCR and from the monitoring will be analyized in R programming language using the base statistical analysis program and ggplot2.
