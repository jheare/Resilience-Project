#Experiment Plan
____

**Summary**
Each population has 66 oysters held at 8&deg;C for 2 weeks prior to experiment.  Oysters will be split into Control (no stress), Mechanical stress, Heat stress.  Mechanical stress will be performed by centrifuging  oysters for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm (Roberts et al. 2011). Heat stress will be performed by placing a beaker of seawater in a water bath set to 38&deg;C for 1 hour (based on Brown et al. 2004). Tissues (Mantle/Ctendia) from oysters will be sampled after stress exposure and placed in RNAlater (or liquid nitrogen) for RNA Isolation. Remaining oysters will be monitored for mortality.
