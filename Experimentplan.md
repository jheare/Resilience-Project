#Experiment Plan
____

**Summary**
Each population has ~66 oysters held at 8&deg;C for 2 weeks prior to experiment.  Oysters will be split into Control (no stress), Mechanical stress, Heat stress.  Mechanical stress will be performed by centrifuging  oysters for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm (Roberts et al. 2011). Heat stress will be performed by placing a beaker of seawater in a water bath set to 38&deg;C for 1 hour (based on Brown et al. 2004). Tissues (Mantle/Ctendia) from oysters will be sampled after stress exposure and placed in Tri-Reagent (or liquid nitrogen) for RNA Isolation. Remaining oysters will be monitored for mortality.

# Experiment

Heat Stress
---

- 22 oysters each pop dropped (stagger each pop by 20 minutes) into prewarmed 38&deg;C sea water (1 hr timer started)    
	- N pop first, H pop next, S pop last     
- after 1 hour exposure heat stress ends, animals returned to 8&deg;C water.
- **1 hour post exposure** 7 animals sampled from each group **plus 7 control animals from the same population** staggered by 20 minutes (or based on when treatment ends)
	- N pop first, H pop next, S pop last
	- collected with ethanol flame sterilized forceps and scissors
		- tools kept in 100% EtOH
		- ran through EtOH flame
		- allow EtOH to burn off
		- Collect tissue
		- replace in 100% EtOH
		- wipe occasionally with paper towel and resterilize
	- ctenidia sample (50-100 mg) homogenized in 1 ml Trizol stored at -20&deg;C
	-  2nd ctenidia sample (any remaining) in 1.5 ml screw cap tube dropped into liquid nitrogen
	- mantle sample (decent size) in 1.5 ml screw cap tube dropped into liquid nitrogen
	- remaining tissue placed (possibly minus digestive system) in 15 ml conical with 75% EtOH
	- shells cleaned and labeled so correspond to sample including oyster id

Mechanical Stress
---

- 22 oysters from 1 pop dropped into salad spinner (stagger each pop by 20 minutes) spun for 5 minutes.  **Use of centrifuge is also an option** would just need to make sure it is balanced.  _If going with salad spinner will need to estimate rotation speed._ Completed after all heat shock treatments and samples were taken.
	- N pop first, H pop next, S pop last
- after 5 minutes of  mechanical stress, animals returned to 8&deg;C water
- **1 hour post exposure** 7 animals sampled from each group **plus 7 control animals from the same population** staggered by 20 minutes 
	- N pop first, H pop next, S pop last
