#that I want to compare all the Ct (labelled sig.cpD2) and generate expression data for them but these values have to be
#in individual columns. To do this I must transpose the data and set the first row as the column names.
rep1res<-setNames(data.frame(t(rep1ct)),rep1ct[,1])

#to eliminate this issue, I copied the first column into a new column called "Names"
rep1res$Names<-rownames(rep1res)

#Since each sample name contains information such as Population, Treatment, and Sample Number I want to separate out these factors
#into new columns so that I can run future analysis based on population, treatment, or both. Also note the "drop = F" this is so the original names column remains.

#In transposing the data frame, the column entries became factors which cannot be used for equations.
#to fix this, I set the entries for sig.eff (efficiency) and sig.cpD2 (Ct value) to numeric. Be aware, without the as.character function the factors will be transformed inappropriately.

#Now I want to get expression information from my data set. qpcR has a way of doing this but its complicated and I'm not comfortable using it.
#Luckily there is an equation I can use to do it. The equation is expression = 1/(1+efficiency)^Ctvalue. I tried multiple ways to get this to work in R
#but it doesn't handle the complicated equation easily.
#To work around this, I created a function in R to run the equation and produce an outcome. x = efficiency argument, y=Ctvalue argument
